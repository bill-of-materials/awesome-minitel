One could criticize this repository to be opinionated, and they would probably
be right... This is a personal list containing projects I found useful at some
point of my research.

Please know I would be very glad to read any PR you would open. Yet, please be
aware that I could feel the need to entirely rewrite its content afterward, or
just choose not to integrate your work.

My priority is to maximize the accessibility of Minitel revival techniques.
Completeness is something that we won't be able to achieve here, since there is
so many people out there who tried their best to describe their work on Minitel.
I may favor one project over another because of its exhaustiveness, simplicity
or just because of the way it was written. Please don't take it personally :)

I also make mistakes and may have missed a very important part of the work some
people have been doing out there. Fell free to tell it to me, I'd be glad to
add new things to the repository if it is relevant!

Thank you for your kindness and suggestions :)


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
